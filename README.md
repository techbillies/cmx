Place your comics in the assets folder and add the filenames to the inv array at the top of the main.js file. 

You might want to translate the button names as I've created this project to distribute a french language comic. The classnames are all in english.

There's no routing in place yet, so you won't be able to link to a specific comic yet (unless you link to the actual image).
